Art gallery showcase

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW
-------------------
Project Title: Art gallery showcase
Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
--------------------
The current Art Gallery system follows a manual method for managing artworks, artist details, and exhibitions. This manual system creates several problems that affect efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility.
Manual record keeping of artwork and artist information often leads to data loss, duplication, and human errors.
Physical registers and files make searching, updating, and maintaining records time-consuming.
Limited physical space restricts the number of artworks that can be displayed at a time.
Visitors must be physically present, which limits reach and accessibility.
Managing exhibitions manually increases workload and operational complexity.
Lack of a digital platform results in poor interaction between artists and visitors.
Due to these drawbacks, the existing manual system is inefficient and outdated. Hence, there is a need for a web-based Art Gallery Showcase system that provides secure data storage, easy access, efficient management, and improved user interaction.
3. PROPOSED SOLUTION
--------------------
The proposed system is a web-based Art Gallery Showcase designed to overcome the limitations of the existing manual art gallery system. It provides a centralized digital platform for managing artworks, artists, and exhibitions efficiently.
In the proposed system, artists can register and upload their artworks along with relevant details such as title, category, medium, and description. All artwork information is stored securely in a database, eliminating issues related to data loss and manual record keeping. Visitors can access the gallery online to browse artworks, view artist profiles, and explore exhibitions without geographical restrictions.
The system includes an administrative module that allows the admin to manage users, approve artworks, organize exhibitions, and maintain gallery records. Searching, filtering, and categorization features make it easier for users to find artworks quickly. The proposed system reduces manual effort, improves accuracy, and enhances user interaction by providing a structured and user-friendly interface.
Overall, the proposed system offers better accessibility, efficient data management, improved security, and a modern digital experience compared to the traditional manual system.
